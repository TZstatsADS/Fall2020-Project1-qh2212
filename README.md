### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Demographic Study on the ANES Cumulative Time Series Data
+ This project is conducted by Qinzhe Hu

+ Project summary: In this project, I select four demographic variables to do a brief research on the demographic structure of voters. They are age group, race, gender and work status. We noticed that the average level for these four variables cannot interprete the change of themsleves as time goes by. Therefore, we use two methods to interprete the portrait of voters and compare the results of these two methods. After analyzing the rate changing and absolute value changes on the span of time, we find that the voters' portriats changes significantly when there is a change of race of president candidates. We also notice that the voter who has less policy strength are willing to vote more, such like women and non-white citizens.
